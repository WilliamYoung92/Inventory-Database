# Inventory-Database
The user adds, edits, and shows inventory through HTML using PHP communicating with an SQL database.
My role in this team project on Github was to create the following pages:
  1 Add part to Inventory
  2 Edit part in Inventory
  3 Create a kit of many parts
  4 Pull a report of parts in the database.
